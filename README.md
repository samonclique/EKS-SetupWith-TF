Certainly! Here's a README.md file for setting up EKS with Terraform and installing the AWS CLI on Windows:

# EKS Setup with Terraform

## Installing AWS CLI

### Prerequisites
- Supported versions of 64-bit Windows
- Admin rights to install software

### Install or Update AWS CLI
1. **Download the AWS CLI MSI installer for Windows (64-bit):**
   - [AWSCLIV2.msi](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi)

2. **Run the installer using `msiexec`:**
   ```
   C:\> msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
   ```

   For a silent installation, use the `/qn` flag:
   ```
   C:\> msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi /qn
   ```

3. **Confirm the installation:**
   Open the Start menu, search for `cmd` to open a command prompt window, and run:
   ```
   C:\> aws --version
   ```

   You should see output similar to:
   ```
   aws-cli/2.15.30 Python/3.11.6 Windows/10 exe/AMD64 prompt/off
   ```

4. **Troubleshooting:**
   If Windows can't find the program, try closing and reopening the command prompt window to refresh the path. For additional troubleshooting, refer to the [Troubleshoot AWS CLI errors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-troubleshooting.html) guide.
